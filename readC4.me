# C4 Model Documentation

This document provides an overview of the C4 model architecture documentation for the Entrada Ãšnica system.

## C4 Model Levels

The C4 model is represented through four levels of abstraction:

1. [Level 1: System Context Diagram](C1Arch.me)
   - Shows the system in its environment
   - Identifies users and external systems
   - Defines system boundaries

2. [Level 2: Container Diagram](C2Arch.me)
   - Breaks down the system into containers
   - Shows the high-level technical building blocks
   - Illustrates how containers communicate

3. [Level 3: Component Diagram](C3Arch.me)
   - Details the components within containers
   - Shows how components interact
   - Provides a more detailed view of the system's internal structure

4. [Level 4: Code Diagram](C4Arch.me)
   - Represents the implementation details
   - Shows how the components are implemented
   - Provides the most detailed view of the system

## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start with the System Context Diagram (C1) to understand the system's place in the world
2. Move to the Container Diagram (C2) to see the high-level technical architecture
3. Use the Component Diagram (C3) to understand how the system is structured internally
4. Refer to the Code Diagram (C4) for implementation details

## Note

These diagrams are maintained using the C4 model notation and should be updated whenever significant architectural changes occur in the system.
