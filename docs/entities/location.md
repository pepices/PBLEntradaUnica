    A[Start] --> B{Location Type}
    B -->|New Location| C[Create Location]
    B -->|Existing Location| D[Search Location]
    C --> E[Validate Address]
    D --> F[View Location Details]
    E --> G[Assign Machines]
    F --> H{Action}
    G --> I[Assign Interlocutors]
    H -->|Update| J[Modify Location]
    H -->|Delete| K[Deactivate Location]
    H -->|View| L[View Relationships]
    I --> M[End]
    J --> M
    K --> M
    L --> M
```

## Entity Diagram
```mermaid

    LOCATION ||--o{ MACHINE : "contains"
    LOCATION ||--o{ LOCATION_INTERLOCUTOR : "has"
    LOCATION {
        long location_id PK
        string name
        string address
        string city
        string postal_code
        string phone
        string status
        datetime created_date
        string created_by
    }
    MACHINE {
        long machine_id PK
        long location_id FK
        string serial_number
        string model
        string status
    }
    LOCATION_INTERLOCUTOR {
        long location_id FK
        long interlocutor_id FK
        string relationship_type
    }
```

## Business Rules
1. Each location must have a unique identifier
2. Locations can have multiple machines
3. Locations can have multiple interlocutors
4. Location status must be one of: Active, Inactive, Pending, Suspended

## Technical Implementation
### Data Access Layer
- Uses Jaguar server components for data access
- Implements CRUD operations through stored procedures
- Handles location validation and business rules

### User Interface
- Location search and filtering
- Location details view
- Machine assignment interface
- Interlocutor relationship management

## Integration Points
- Machine Management System
- Interlocutor Management System
- Geographic Information System
- Address Validation Service

## Security Considerations
- Location data access is role-based
- Sensitive location information is encrypted
- Audit trail for all location modifications
