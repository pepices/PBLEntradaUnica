    LOCATION ||--o{ LOCATION_INTERLOCUTOR : "has"
    LOCATION {
        long location_id PK
        string name
        string address
        string city
        string postal_code
        string phone
        string status
        datetime created_date
        string created_by
    }
    MACHINE {
        long machine_id PK
        long location_id FK
        string serial_number
        string model
        string status
    }
    LOCATION_INTERLOCUTOR {
        long location_id FK
        long interlocutor_id FK
        string relationship_type
    }
```

## Business Rules
1. Each location must have a unique identifier
